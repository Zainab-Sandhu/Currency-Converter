I built a simple and user-friendly currency converter using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This web app allows users to select two different currencies and enter an amount to convert. It uses real-time exchange rates from an online API to show the correct converted value. The design is clean and responsive, so it works well on all devices including phones and laptops. This project helped me improve my skills in using APIs, writing JavaScript, and building websites that work smoothly and look good.
